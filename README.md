# Awesome Bayes

A curated list of awesome Bayesian statistics blogs and resources.
The resources may not be explicitly Bayesian-focused,
but you should have a high probability of finding a Bayesian post.
Recent posts are provided for (almost) every resource to indicate the likelihood the author is still writing Bayesian posts.

Inspired by [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python).
