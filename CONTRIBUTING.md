# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome!

## Guidelines

### Additions

* Add one link per Pull Request.
    * Make sure the PR title is in the format of `Add blog-name`.
    * Write down the reason why the resource is awesome.
* Add the link: `* [project-name](http://example.com/)`
* Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Remove any trailing whitespace.

### Updates

* Indicate if you are fixing a broken link or updating a resource

Just a gentle reminder: **Try not to submit your own blog. Instead, wait for someone finds it useful and submits it for you.**
